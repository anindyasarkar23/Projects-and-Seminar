# Projects-and-Seminar
This contains my project on IOT and the seminar topic 

The IOT project was a group work and our team consisted of 5 members including me. We together built a Voice and App Controlled Car using Node-MCU. We learnt a lot while making this project.It was fun working with every member of my team.

The seminar topic is Flexible Electronic Skin which I along with another friend of mine have prepared for the seminar. We grouped together and created a report on this interesting topic.
